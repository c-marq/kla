## 🎤 **Visual Feedback for Microphone**

### Gentle Pulsing Animation

When the microphone is active and listening, students see:

#### **Pulsing Button**
- Gentle scale animation (1.0 → 1.05)
- Soft shadow expansion
- 2-second cycle (slow and calming)
- Non-distracting movement

#### **Expanding Ring**
- Subtle ring expands outward
- Fades from 60% to 0% opacity
- Shows "listening" state clearly
- Doesn't interfere with other elements

### Benefits
- ✅ **Clear Feedback**: Students know when they're being heard
- ✅ **Reduced Anxiety**: Visual confirmation reduces uncertainty
- ✅ **Non-Distracting**: Gentle animation doesn't pull focus
- ✅ **Predictable**: Consistent 2-second rhythm

### Implementation
```scss
.mic-button.listening {
  animation: gentle-pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

## 🗣️ **Speech Recognition Indicator**

### Animated Sound Waves

When speech is being recognized, a floating indicator appears showing:

#### **Visual Elements**
1. **Sound Waves**: 5 animated bars that pulse with speech
2. **"Listening..." Text**: Clear status message
3. **Floating Card**: Positioned above controls, doesn't block content
4. **Smooth Animation**: Slides up when appearing

#### **Processing State**
When AI is processing speech:
- Sound waves change to spinning circle
- Text changes to "Processing..."
- Same calming design language

### Benefits
- ✅ **Status Clarity**: Students always know what's happening
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion**: No wondering if mic is working
- ✅ **Visual Engagement**: Animated feedback feels responsive
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Works without sound

### Positioning
- **Desktop**: Bottom center, above control buttons
- **Mobile**: Adjusted for smaller screens
- **Never Blocks**: Positioned to avoid content overlap

document.body.classList.add('theme-dark');
```

### CSS Variables
```scss
// Normal mode
--mdc-blue: #3D8BCC;
--mdc-orange: #E87D3E;

// Dark mode overrides
body.theme-dark {
  --mdc-blue: #5B9FD8;
  --mdc-orange: #E89B6A;
}
```

### Animations
```scss
// Gentle pulsing (2 seconds)
@keyframes gentle-pulse {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.05); }
}

// Expanding ring
@keyframes pulse-ring {
  0% { opacity: 0.6; transform: scale(0.9); }
