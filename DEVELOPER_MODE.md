# Developer Mode - MDC Shark Assistant

## Overview

The developer console is **hidden by default** to provide a clean, distraction-free interface for neurodivergent students taking business intelligence courses at Miami Dade College.

---

## üîì Enabling Developer Mode

### Keyboard Shortcut
Press **`Ctrl + Shift + D`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd + Shift + D`** (Mac)

### What Happens
1. A blue notification appears confirming the toggle
2. The developer console panel appears on the left side
3. You can now view technical logs and debug information

### To Disable
Press the same keyboard shortcut again: **`Ctrl + Shift + D`**

## üéØ Why Hidden by Default?

### For Students
- **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Students can focus on learning, not technical details
- **Prevents Confusion**: Technical logs can be overwhelming for non-technical users
- **Clean Interface**: Keeps the UI simple and student-friendly
- **Distraction-Free**: Supports neurodivergent learners who need minimal visual noise

### For Instructors & Developers
- **Easy Access**: Quick keyboard shortcut when needed
- **Full Logging**: All technical information still available when enabled
- **Debugging Support**: View real-time AI communication logs
- **Development Tools**: Monitor tool calls, API responses, and errors

---

## üìä What You See in Developer Mode

When enabled, the developer console shows:

### Conversation Logs
- **User Messages**: What students are asking
- **AI Responses**: What the assistant is answering
- **Timestamps**: When each interaction occurred

### Tool Usage
- **Function Calls**: When AI uses tools (search, calculations, etc.)
- **Parameters**: What data is being passed
- **Results**: What the tools return

### Technical Logs
- **WebSocket Status**: Connection state
- **API Calls**: Communication with Gemini AI
- **Errors**: Any technical issues that occur
- **Performance**: Response times and data flow

### Filtering Options
- **Conversations**: View only chat interactions
- **Tool Use**: View only AI tool calls
- **All**: View everything

## üéì Best Practices

### For Instructors
1. **Keep it hidden** during regular student use
2. **Enable temporarily** when troubleshooting student issues
3. **Use for demonstrations** when teaching about AI systems
4. **Show students** how it works if they're interested in the technology

### For Developers
1. **Use during development** to debug issues
2. **Monitor performance** to optimize user experience
3. **Test features** before deploying to students
4. **Document issues** found in the logs

### For Students (Advanced)
- **Not required** for normal use of the assistant
- **Optional learning** for students interested in AI technology
- **Safe to explore** - won't break anything
- **Ask permission** from your instructor before using in class

## üîß Technical Details

### Implementation
- Hidden via React state (`developerMode` boolean)
- Keyboard listener in `SidePanel.tsx`
- No data loss when hidden (logs still collected)
- Auto-opens when developer mode is enabled

### Keyboard Shortcut Logic
```typescript
// Listens for Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D
if ((e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) && e.shiftKey && e.key === 'D') {
  setDeveloperMode(!developerMode);
}
```

### Privacy Note
- Logs are **client-side only** (not sent to any server)
- Data is **cleared on page refresh**
- **No persistent storage** of student conversations
- **FERPA compliant** - student data stays private

## üìù Tips & Tricks

### Quick Actions
1. **Toggle quickly**: `Ctrl+Shift+D` multiple times to verify it works
